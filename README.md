# Spatial trajectory segmentation and analysis
q
<p>University project of the <b>Geospatial data management</b> course focused on the implementation and comparison of three different <b>spatial trajectories segmentation algorithms</b> described in the following research papers:

</ul></p>

<p>The segmentation is based on the well-known <b>stop-move model</b> and applied to data about the movements of persons in a museum.<br>
After the segmentation step, some analyses were performed on the result to find the most visited exhibits and the number of people standing together by the same exhibit using <a href="https://mobilitydb.com/">MobilityDB</a>, a novel DBMS specialized in trajectory data management that supports data types representing values changing over time and specialized operations over them.</p>
